			I like to play videogames, watch anime and series, movies also but not so much. I love to read manga, lately I almost only read webtoons, I also listen music in my free time

			I can't say one series over other so I'll just say a bunch of the ones I really liked, Avatar: The last airbender, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Gintama, One Piece, The Mentalist, Bones, Dr. House and Close Enough
